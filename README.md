# OCNode
Simple CRUD Back-end realized following the free course "Go Fullstack with Node.js and MongoDB" on OpenClassroom.
You can find it here : https://openclassrooms.com/fr/courses/6390246-passez-au-full-stack-avec-node-js-express-et-mongodb in french.



/!\ The front-end isn't mine /!\
You can find it in my repo OCNode-front if you want to see the full project.
A complete remake of the front part will come.
